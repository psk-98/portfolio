# An h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.
2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists look like:

- this one
- that one
- the other one
  Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text content starts at 4-columns in.
  > Block quotes are
  > written like so.
  >
  > They can span multiple paragraphs,
  > if you like.
  > Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
  > Unicode is supported. â˜º
