### Introduction

Scrolling in an essential part of modern web development, but at times you might want to ‘’Scroll Lock’’ especially when it interferes with the user experience. To address this, we’ll introduce the concept of ‘’Scroll Lock’’ and how you can create your own custom Scroll Lock hook. In this guide, we'll explore what Scroll Lock is, why it matters, and how to implement a Scroll Lock hook to create a smooth and user-friendly scrolling experience.

Scroll lock is way programmatically disable and enable the native scroll behaviour of a web page or specific element/s on the page. This allows you the developer to control and manipulate scrolling based on certain conditions, making it a powerful tool to enhance the user experience.

Scroll Lock can therefore be useful in various scenarios:

- Sidebar - Imagine you want a semi-transparent background for your sidebar, but you then realize the user can still scroll while the sidebar is open. This was the initial scenario which made think about how I could Scroll Lock.

- Modal and Pop-ups – These could be a form, product pop-up on a store etc, with Scroll Lock you can prevent users from accidentally scrolling the background content, ensuring that their focus remains on the modal.

### Implementation

To get start, create your react or nextjs app as you normally would, Im using nextjs 13

```bash
npx create-next-app@13 scroll-lock
```

Create a new directory in scroll-lock and call it hooks, inside the hooks directory create a file and call it useScrollLock.js and add the following in the file.

```js useScrollLock.js
// hooks/useScrollLock.js

export default function useScrollLock() {
  const lock = () => {
    document.body.style.overflowY = "hidden"
  }

  const unlock = () => {
    document.body.style.overflowY = "scroll"
  }

  return [lock, unlock]
}
```

Next create another new directory call it components inside components create nav.js. Inside this nav component is where we use the useScrollLock hook, so add the following in the nav.js.

```jsx
// src/components/nav.jsx

import useScrollLock from "@/hooks/useScrollLock"
import { Inter } from "next/font/google"
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] })

export default function Nav() {
  const [toggle, setToggle] = useState(false)
  const [lock, unlock] = useScrollLock()

  useEffect(() => {
    toggle ? lock() : unlock()
  }, [toggle])

  return (
    <div className={inter.className}>
      <nav>
        <span className="logo">Scroll Lock Academy</span>
        <div className="burger" onClick={() => setToggle(!toggle)}>
          <div></div>
          <div></div>
          <div></div>
        </div>
        <div className={`nav-links-wrapper ${toggle ? "" : "no-show"}`}>
          <div className="nav-links">
            <div className="nav-link">Home</div>
            <div className="nav-link">About</div>
            <div className="nav-link">Contact</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Next add the nav in index.js and enough content so the page is scrollable. Run your application and the hook should be working now
