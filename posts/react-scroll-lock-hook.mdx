### Introduction

Scrolling is an essential part of modern web development, but at times you might
want to scroll lock especially when it interferes with the user experience. To
address this, I’ll introduce the concept of scroll lock and how you can create
your own custom scroll lock hook. In this guide, we'll explore what scroll lock
is, why it matters, and how to implement a scroll lock hook for a better user
experience.

Scroll lock is a way to programmatically disable and enable the native scroll
behaviour of a web page or specific element/s on the page. This allows you the
developer to control and manipulate scrolling based on certain conditions,
making it a powerful tool to enhance the user experience.

- Scroll Lock can therefore be useful in various use cases:

- Sidebar – Imagine you want a semi-transparent background for your sidebar, but
  you then realize the user can still scroll while the sidebar is open. This was
  my initial use case which made me think about how I could Scroll Lock. It is
  also the example I use in this guide.

- Modal and Pop-ups – These could be a form, product pop-up on a store etc, with
  Scroll Lock you can prevent users from accidentally scrolling the background
  content, ensuring that their focus remains on the modal.

### Implementation

To get started, create your [react](https://react.dev/) or
[next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app as you normally would, I’m using
[next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/) so I used the command below.

```bash
npx create-next-app@13 scroll-lock
```

After creating the app, create a new directory in the base directory (mine is
scroll-lock) and call the new directory hooks. Inside the hooks directory create
a file and call it useScrollLock.js and add the following in the file.

```js useScrollLock.js
// hooks/useScrollLock.js

export default function useScrollLock() {
  const lock = () => {
    document.body.style.overflowY = "hidden"
  } // call this function to change the overflowY property to "hidden"

  const unlock = () => {
    document.body.style.overflowY = "scroll"
  } // call this function to change the overflowY property to "hidden"

  return [lock, unlock]
}
```

First we create a function useScrollLock and inside it the lock and unlock
functions, since we want to modify a CSS property in the body we access it using
the document object. Here we change the style of
[overflowY](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-y) to
“hidden” for enabling the scrollLock and “scroll” to disable, the reason for
using [overflowY](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-y)
instead of just overflow is we want to manipulate the vertical scroll. Therefore
for horizontal scroll it would be
[overflowX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-x) and
just [overflow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) for
both, we then return the two functions lock and unlock.

Next create another new directory inside src call it components, inside the
components directory create a file nav.js. Inside nav.js is where we use the
useScrollLock hook, so add the following in nav.js.

```js
// src/components/nav.js

import useScrollLock from "@/hooks/useScrollLock"
import { Inter } from "next/font/google"
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] })
// so we can use inter font for text its a next.js thing

export default function Nav() {
  const [toggle, setToggle] = useState(false)
  // initialize toggle and set initial value to false

  const [lock, unlock] = useScrollLock()
  // initialize functions from useScrollLock so we can call them below

  useEffect(() => {
    toggle ? lock() : unlock()
    // ternary operator calls lock() if toggle is true
    // otherwise calls unlock() if toggle is false
  }, [toggle])
  // [toggle] basically tells useEffect to listen for a change in toggle

  return (
    <div className={inter.className}>{// toggle}
      <nav>
        <span className="logo">Scroll Lock Academy</span>
        <div
          className="burger"
          onClick={() => {
            setToggle(!toggle)
            // this is change the toggle state
          }}
        >
          <div></div>
          <div></div>
          <div></div>
        </div>
        <div className={`nav-links-wrapper ${toggle ? "" : "no-show"}`}>
          <div className="nav-links">
            <div className="nav-link">Home</div>
            <div className="nav-link">About</div>
            <div className="nav-link">Contact</div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </nav>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Most of the code above is for creating a basic navbar with a sidebar that you
can toggle, I’ll highlight the code that makes the scroll lock work. So, we
first import useEffect and useScrollLock that we created earlier.

```js
const [lock, unlock] = useScrollLock()
// initialize functions from useScrollLock so we can call them below

useEffect(() => {
  toggle ? lock() : unlock()
  // ternary operator calls lock() if toggle is true
  // otherwise calls unlock() if toggle is false
}, [toggle])
// [toggle] basically tells useEffect to listen for a change in toggle
```

We then initialize lock and unlock, then use useEffect to listen for any changes
in toggle state. If the toggle state changes the ternary operator will either
call the lock function if toggle state is true or the unlock function if toggle
state is false. We then add the onClick event to the burger as show below.

```html
<div
  className="burger"
  onClick={() => {
    setToggle(!toggle)
    // this is change the toggle state
  }}
>
  <!--your burger icon would be here -->
</div>
```

Next add the nav in pages/index.js (this would be App.js for
[react](https://react.dev/)) and enough content so the page is scrollable. Run
your application and the hook should be working now.

Implementing scroll lock for older iOS devices (iOS 12 and older according to
[this](<(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow)>)) requires
a slightly different approach so if you don’t need to support those devices you
can jump to the conclusion. According to the
[numbers here](https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/) at the time of
writing, about 6% and 9% iOS users are on iOS 14 or older on iPhone and iPad
respectively so if you need to support those, here are great articles by
[Markus](https://markus.oberlehner.net/blog/simple-solution-to-prevent-body-scrolling-on-ios/)
and
[Anton](https://medium.com/react-camp/how-to-fight-the-body-scroll-2b00267b37ac).

### Conclusion

So to recap, use
[overflow: hidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) to
scroll lock on all devices except older iOS or the other way which I haven’t
mentioned is to use a library. If you have better solution please do tell, till
next time <span className="color">HAPPY CODING</span>.
