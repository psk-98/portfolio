#Welcome to My [Portfolio Website](https://paulkhoza.netlify.app/)

This website is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a framework for building server-rendered React applications. It also utilizes [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations, React-Intersection-Observer for tracking when elements enter and leave the viewport, and Prettier and ESLint for code formatting.

To get started, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, clone the repository and run npm install to install all of the dependencies.

To start a development server, run npm run dev. This will start the server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and will automatically reload the page when changes are made.

To build the application for production, run npm run build and then npm run start.

Please check package.json for more scripts and details

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website. I hope you enjoy browsing through my work!
